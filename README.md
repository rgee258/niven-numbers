# Niven Numbers

Featured in this project are [Niven numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harshad_number), where you can see all of the Niven numbers from 0 to 100.

I did this project as a refresher to get back into using Javascript. It's surprising how rusty you can get when you haven't touched a language in a while, but I suppose that's like anything. 

The CSS in this project was done using Sass, which I had used previously in Rails with embedded Ruby but never directly with regular CSS. Using scss as it is intended is going to take some getting used to.

Inspiration for this project was based on a mini code challenge seen in this [Tumblr post](https://aestheticallypleasingcode.tumblr.com/post/183091640656/code-golf).
